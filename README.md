# Cat Dog Classifier using AlexNet

This project implements a Cat Dog Classifier using the AlexNet architecture, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained to differentiate between images of cats and dogs, achieving high accuracy in the classification task.

## Overview

The Cat Dog Classifier project aims to demonstrate the use of deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks, for image classification tasks. The project utilizes the AlexNet architecture, which is a popular CNN architecture for image classification tasks.
## Model Architecture

The model architecture is based on the AlexNet architecture, which consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, batch normalization, and fully connected layers. The model is trained using the training dataset and optimized using gradient descent with backpropagation.
